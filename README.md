# Elytra Trinket

A Minecraft Fabric mod that adds the Elytra to the cape slot in the Trinkets API.

Requires the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and [Trinkets](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets) or [Trinkets Canary](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets-canary).

This mod is just a lightweight version of [Elytra Slot](https://modrinth.com/mod/elytra-slot).
I made it because I was unsatisfied with how slowly it updated.
If that mod is up-to-date, I suggest using it instead, as it supports:

- Fabric, Forge, and Quilt (as opposed to just Fabric).
- Some modded Elytra variants.

Any combination of Elytra Slot and Elytra Trinket on the client and server works.

## Deprecation Notice

This mod will not be updated starting with the release of Minecraft version 26.1. The primary reason for this is that Trinkets, the primary dependency of this mod, hasn't been updated in a year and a half as of the time I'm writing this. A fork, Trinkets Canary, does exist for newer versions, but in general it seems like more mods in the future will start to use [Accessories](https://modrinth.com/mod/accessories) instead. Since Accessories already allows the use of Elytra as a built-in trinket, this mod no longer has much of a reason to exist.
