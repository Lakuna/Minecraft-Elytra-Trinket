# Elytra Trinket

A Minecraft Fabric mod that adds the Elytra to the cape slot in the Trinkets API.

Requires the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and [Trinkets](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets).

This mod is just a lightweight version of [Elytra Slot](https://modrinth.com/mod/elytra-slot).
I made it because I was unsatisfied with how slowly it updated.
If that mod is up-to-date, I suggest using it instead, as it supports:
- Fabric, Forge, and Quilt (as opposed to just Fabric).
- Some modded Elytra variants.
